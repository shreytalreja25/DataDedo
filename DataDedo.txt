Today we will be working on a project called "DataDedo" . this will be a MERN stack application and will have the following flow :

1. There will be a login screen with user to Either Login by entering username and password or by creating a new user. The login screen will also have Login with third party apps like : Facebook , google and twitter.

2. After logging in the user will be redirected to the dashboard. The dashboard will have a top bar which will say "DataDedo" in the left hand side and in the right hand side there will be 3 icons : Home, Profile and Logout. 

3. The dashboard will be divided into 4 rectangles placed in a 2x2 manner. First card will Say Welcome to the user and give a brief description of DataDedo. The second card will Have an area for user to drag and drop either CSV or XLS files which will contain some data. The user will be able to upload their data here which will get stored in the database.The third card will show the last data uploaded by the user in a datatable format. The fourth card will show some graphical visualizations from the Data user uploaded in last session

4. After uploading the data using the Second card of Data upload, the user will be prompted by a big modal popup wherein the user will set the name of their new Project , the name of the file , a Create New Project Button and a preview of the Data they just uploaded.

5. After the user has Created their new project the data they uploaded will be shown in a datatable format and the user will have the option to Edit the rows or delete the rows (Basically perform CRUD operations in their Data). 

6. After the user has managed their data , they will have a button to "Visualize their Data" on top right corner of their data which will take the user to a page where they can see the graphical visualizations of their data using various charts.

7. The visualize your data tab will also have a text box for users to enter a prompt that will use AI and ML tools to prepare charts of the Data.  For example : If user enters "Prepare a pie chart of the users based on their location" then a pie chart will be drawn based on the users data.

Understand the complete functionality and flow of the application and explain it back to me. Suggest me more feature that I can add to this app. Ask me if you have any doubts regarding the app.Once we are set with the structure of the app we will start building it. We will be using MERN stack to make this app and use Visual Studio Code to code and Github as a version control tool. keep all this in mind and generate a development and production plan for the app. Also generate your views about the Idea for the app.
